In my full stack project, I used two main approaches for frontend developmentâ€”Express HTML with JavaScript and a single-page application (SPA) approach. The traditional method involving Express HTML and JavaScript was more static, relying on server-side rendering, suitable for simpler, less interactive pages. In contrast, the SPA approach provided a more dynamic user experience by loading a single HTML page and updating it as needed with JavaScript, all without requiring a full page reload. This resulted in a smoother and faster user experience, especially for the administrative section of the application.
The backend used the NoSQL MongoDB database, for its ability to manage data flexibly. The way MongoDB stores data in JSON documents sets it apart from databases and makes it ideal for applications that often modify data structures or deal with diverse data formats. Without a fixed schema, this structure allowed the software to adjust promptly to feature demands and expand efficiently.
JSON is not the same, as JavaScript because JSON serves as a method for exchanging data while JavaScript is a language for coding and functions. The significance of JSON lies in its ability to connect the end and back-end systems by enabling data transmission between the server and client in a mutually understandable format. For example, during the login verification process, user details are transmitted in format, from the user interface to the server. 
During the software development process, from end to back-end tasks I worked by restructuring the code to boost efficiency mainly by dividing intricate user interface (UI) elements into reusable parts This didn't just make it easier to manage but also minimized repetition The advantages of using reusable UI components are evident as they maintain uniformity, throughout the application and simplify making updates or adding features without the need to rewrite the code repeatedly
Testing. 
To test the stack application thoroughly involved confirming the API endpoints using approaches such, as GET, POT, and DELETE requests to check if they returned the accurate information or performed the expected actions as intended. Moreover testing under layers of security added challenges in guaranteeing access for administrative logins. It was essential for the application to encrypt data such, as passwords and utilize tokens for request authentication. 
Testing these endpoints correctly is crucial, for ensuring the application works as intended when dealing with authentication and security measures in mind It's important to test scenarios like logins with correct credentials as well as how the app handles errors, like invalid login details or expired tokens.
This program has helped me advance in my career development focus, on stack development particularly I've learned how to create both the end and back end of web applications incorporate security functionalities, and manage data using a NoSQL database such as MongoDB Moreover hands-on training, with API testing and endpoint security has enhanced my knowledge on developing secure and expandable applications.
